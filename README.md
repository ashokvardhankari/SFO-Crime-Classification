# SFO-Crime-Classification
The goal for project is to predict the category of crime, given time and location it occurred. Also to explore the dataset visually and find interesting patterns of crimes occurred.

This is a term project in my class CS 584 - Theory and Applications of Data Mining. I along with another colleague Anusha Ganti developed this project in Spring 2016.

To review our findings please check the report titled SFO Crime Classification Final Report.pdf. Do not refrain to shoot back at us for any questions/ concerns.
